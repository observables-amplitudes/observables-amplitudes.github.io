A huge surge of experimental data coming from the LHC and the new
generation of gravitational detectors provides a unique opportunity to
test the Standard Model of particle physics and Einstein's theory of
gravity. For successful implementation of this program, we need powerful
methods for deriving high precision theory predictions for the revelant
physical observables.


This project ***Observables*** (ANR-24-CE31-7996) supported by the French [Agence nationale pour la recherche](https://anr.fr) aims to develop new techniques for
  computing scattering amplitudes with a large number of particles involved in perturbation theory in both gauge theory and classical and quantum gravitational  theories

A focus for will be to calculate three different classes of observables:
+ differential cross-sections at large multiplicities relevant to LHC
physics
+ energy correlations allowing us to understand the properties of
jets in QCD 
+ gravitational observables for the analysis of gravitational waves 
emitted from binary systems.

We will build on recent advances in the field of "Amplitudes" and use
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, integrability, algebraic-geometric
methods as applied to gauge theory observables

Our goal is to obtain
new results for the above mentioned observables and uncover hidden
structures in gauge theories and gravity.
